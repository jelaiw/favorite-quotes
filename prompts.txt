Analyze this codebase to generate or update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for guiding AI coding agents.

Focus on discovering the essential knowledge that would help an AI agents be immediately productive in this codebase. Consider aspects like:
- The "big picture" architecture that requires reading multiple files to understand - major components, service boundaries, data flows, and the "why" behind structural decisions
- Critical developer workflows (builds, tests, debugging) especially commands that aren't obvious from file inspection alone
- Project-specific conventions and patterns that differ from common practices
- Integration points, external dependencies, and cross-component communication patterns

Source existing AI conventions from `**/{.github/copilot-instructions.md,AGENT.md,AGENTS.md,CLAUDE.md,.cursorrules,.windsurfrules,.clinerules,.cursor/rules/**,.windsurf/rules/**,.clinerules/**,README.md}` (do one glob search).

Guidelines (read more at https://aka.ms/vscode-instructions-docs):
- If `.github/copilot-instructions.md` exists, merge intelligently - preserve valuable content while updating outdated sections
- Write concise, actionable instructions (~20-50 lines) using markdown structure
- Include specific examples from the codebase when describing patterns
- Avoid generic advice ("write tests", "handle errors") - focus on THIS project's specific approaches
- Document only discoverable patterns, not aspirational practices
- Reference key files/directories that exemplify important patterns

Update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for the user, then ask for feedback on any unclear or incomplete sections to iterate.

The parsing logic could be improved. For example lines 1-21 is a single quote (actually a poem by William Ernest Henley). Every line between lines 69-132 appears to be a separate quote. Please try again.

Much improved. I checked the output. The following should be corrected: lines 62 and 63 are separate quotes. Line 81 is actually a quote and a separate URL. Lines 197 and 198 are separate quotes. Lines 212-214 are a single quote.

Act as a data engineer with specific expertise in parsing, cleaning up, and reformatting flat files. The file @fortune/quotes is in Linux fortune file format. Many but not all of the quotes in this file have an attribution. Please reformat the quotes such that the attribution (usually author) is on a separate line.
